## Welcome to my React Calculator for freeCodeCamp

I made this calculator with predominately [React](https://reactjs.org/) as [project #4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) of the Front End Libraries, part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.

##### To do list
- _I could spend more time to make the "feel" of the calculator more realistic, via extra shades, shadows, depth and possibly even audio whenever clicking a button._
- _I saw an interesting example where the creator added a small-solar panel. When you drag your mouse above it, the display fades (because it would in real-life get less energy)_
- _Possibly I can add functionality that you don't need the mouse to click buttons, but you can use the keys on the keyboard._
- _Most importantly, I should consider rewriting part of the "calculation-engine". I saw an amazing method and I re-used this, instead of fully creating it myself. More specifically: it is the "computation"-part. Where the logic is not mine, but I did customize it a lot later so except for the calculation-method itself, lessons have been learned and I did not easily brush past it (at all). _
- _My code is not dense enough. The densest and prettiest method I found was in a YouTube-clip by "Web Dev Simplified". But there was no option to re-use his code because it was so dense that I wouldn't be able to use my own creativity to at least learn something from it._


##### Reasons for suggested changes later on
- For the front-end parts: although I am pretty happy with the current visuals, it would it make even sleeker.
-For the back-end parts: I would be able to write more dense logic code, and by doing the "calculation-engine" myself I would learn something more.

#### UX
- Pretty much like a "normal calculator"
- I used a 2-line system where you can see your previous calculation, but this causes some moments where it is not logical to see the numbers in red or the other way around.
- There is a "delete-button" (the "C"/Clear-button), and a "reset/clear all button" (the "CE"/Clear Everything-button).
- I added a GitHub button which brings the user straight to my GitHub-profile. 
- When hovering and clicking buttons, you see the color and shadow of the button change for improved UX.
- The test-suite of freeCodeCamp is still available in the top-left corner to test if all user-stories are still accomplished.
